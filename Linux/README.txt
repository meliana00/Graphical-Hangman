This is a simple, classic, but fun hangman game, just for the sake of the
good old times.
===========================================================================

===========================================================================
HOW TO PLAY:
You have to save the stickman from getting hung by trying to guess a random
word right every time. You will be given the length of the word, and you 
should find the letters corresponding to that word one by one before the
stickman dies (every wrong guess brings him closer to his death).

NOTE: 
1. Since non of the random words in the game exceeds 9 characters, you 
should remember that the word is NOT ALWAYS a noun; so you might sometimes
face verbs, adjectives, etc. 

2. The game is not supposed to remember your wrong guesses, so be careful
to not repeat your mistakes! For example, if the word does not contain the
letter 'L', by clicking on 'L' multiple times, you'll lose your chances
multiple times as well.
